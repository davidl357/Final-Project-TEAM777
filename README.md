>Steam is a platform for PC gaming. Steam is made by the company Valve. Steam is a way for users to purchase games and launch them. Users can also easily add friends and play Steam games with them. Steam is one of the biggest platforms for PC gaming and is used by millions of users.

>This app takes in the user ID for a steam user and creates an analysis of the user's games and friends. A map is developed with how many of the user's friends are in a country from a global map. A graph is also created that has the top games the user has played and the playtime in hours for those games. A table is created that displays this same data with a column of the playtime in the last 2 weeks. Also a table is created with all the games that the user has with no playtime. There is also a slider that changes the amount of games that are displayed on the graph and games with top games.

> Initially it was hard to determine what parts of the Steam API we wanted to use. We figured out that we could get a list of games that a user has and the stats on those games. We show this in a bar graph. We also have this same data in a table. We also created a table showing games with no play time. This was interesting because a lot of people own games but have never played them. We also created a map of all the users friends with a count of friends in each country. the data from the API gave country codes but it was given in ISO2 so we had to convert them to ISO3. Originally for the map We initially wanted to use a recursive method in order to get friends of friends to get a lot of users. However, this was challenging and time consuming so we chose to scrap that idea.
