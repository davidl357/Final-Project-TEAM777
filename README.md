>Steam is a platform for PC gaming. Steam is made by the company Valve. Steam is a way for users to purchase games and launch them. Users can also easily add friends and play Steam games with them. Steam is one of the biggest platforms for PC gaming and is used by millions of users. 

>This app takes in the user ID for a steam user and creates an analysis of the user's games and friends. A map is developed with how many of the user's friends are in a country from a global map. A graph is also created that has the top games the user has played and the playtime in hours for those games. A table is created that displays this same data with a column of the playtime in the last 2 weeks. Also a table is created with all the games that the user has with no playtime. There is also a slider that changes the amount of games that are displayed on the graph and games with top games.
